# Cracker

Welcome to **Cracker**, a full-stack platform that helps teams _track their creativity_.

This monorepo contains two main apps:

1. `app/` — a Next.js (React) web application backed by GraphQL, Prisma & Postgres.
2. `docs/` — a Docusaurus v3 site (this site) that hosts product & developer documentation.

What you will find in the docs:

* **Guide** – everything you need to get Cracker running locally or in production.
* **Architecture** – a high-level tour of the codebase and the design decisions behind it.
* **API** – the GraphQL schema and example queries/mutations.
* **Reference** – environment variables, database schema & CLI snippets.

If you are new to the project, head to **Getting Started** next ✅.
